This README is specifically for a branch of the github repository named pub. It
provides the exact source code used to create publication results. The main
branch of the repository, in contrast, contains bleeding edge code.

Since we originaly ran the code to create publication results, devtools was
updated to require some new dependencies. Hence, we have updated the
Dockerfile. Aside from this, this pub branch of the repository contains our
exact code and pipeline used for the publication results. That being said,
there is some chance that the results will differ slightly from those we
published since we are using some different package versions, though we have
no specific evidence that this is so. We have maintained the old name for
the repository (stulletal_mcp) to most closely match the publication approach
(i.e., the old name stulletal_mcp was not updated to the new name,
mcp_pipeline).

There are two ways to run the code, both of which use Docker: (1) build a new
Docker image using the Dockerfile that is provided with this repository; or (2)
use the image we placed on Docker Hub in February, 2023. These approaches only
diverge in the ininitial stage. Approach (2) is the best approach for
reproducibility. At the end of the section for Approach (1), we describe the
steps we used to create the image used in approach (2). With approach (1), it
is likely that additional depependencies will be will need to be resolved the
longer it is from February, 2023. This is why we have provided approach (2), so
that the exact Docker image we created in February, 2023, can be used.

# Approach (1): Build a new Docker image "from scratch"

Clone the github repository, enter the new directory, and switch to the pub
branch:

```console
git clone https://github.com/ElaineYChu/stulletal_mcp
cd stulletal_mcp
git checkout pub
```

Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile. To force all docker material to
be (re)downloaded prior to creating the Docker image -- a step you should be
certain you want to take -- use: "docker system prune -a".

```console
docker build -t michaelholtonprice/stulletal_mcp .
```

This will create a Linux image (Ubuntu 20.04), install R, install necessary
dependencies, copy data and script files into the Docker image, and install R
using the script install_yada.R that is part of this repository (specifically,
commit b16034db9d81e59642ffda029ade8f91df669846 of yada is installed).

The remainder of this section describes the steps we took to commit the image
on Docker Hub in February, 2023. To continue with the analysis pipeline, SKIP 
TO the section "Common steps." (There is no need to run the remaining commands
in this section, though you could certainly replicate the Docker image
push if desired with the next two commands, replacing michaelholtonprice
everywhere with your Docker username; you would first need to create a new
repository named stulletal_mcp to receive the push using the Docker Hub
website.)

We added a descriptive tag for the image, which had the ID df9237b5b72f, and
pushed it to Michael Holton Price's Docker Hub repository (a new repository
named stulletal_mcp was first created using the Docker Hub website):

```console
docker tag df9237b5b72f michaelholtonprice/stulletal_mcp:post_build
docker push michaelholtonprice/stulletal_mcp:post_build
```

# Approach (2): Use the Docker image on Docker Hub

Pull (download) the Docker image:

```console
docker pull michaelholtonprice/stulletal_mcp:post_build
```

In fact, the preceding command can probably be skipped since the
"docker run..." command in the following section will pull the image if it has
not already been pulled . However, it is useful to pull it separately to
understand what is happening.

# Common steps
Start a Docker container of the image michaelholtonprice/stulletal_mcp:post_build
using the following command:

```console
docker run --name stulletal_mcp -itv //c/stulletal_mcp_mirrored_dir:/mirrored_dir michaelholtonprice/stulletal_mcp:post_build
```

The preceding command places the user at a command line "inside" the Docker
container. The -v tag in the command mirrors a directory on the host machine

(C:\mcp_pipeline_mirrored_dir) to a directory inside the Docker container
(/mirrored_dir) that can be used to pass files between the host machine and the
Docker container. The directory to the left of the semicolon is for the host
machine and the directory to the right of the semicolon is for the Docker
container. The path for the host machine may need to be modified for your
situation.

Change directory (cd) into stulletal_mcp (where files were copied during
creation of the Docker image; see the Dockerfile) and run all the analysis
and result generation scripts (this will take a very long time -- likely over
a week):

```console
cd stulletal_mcp
Rscript run_all_analyses.R
```

Finally, copy the results to the mirrored directory:

```console
cp -fr ./results /mirrored_dir
```
