# The preceding script in the "pipeline" is "solvey_US_univariate.R", which 
# conducts a maximum likelihood fits for each response variable with six 
# parameteric  model choices for the ordinal variables and two for the 
# continuous variables.
# This script uses those fits to write cross-validation reports for each
# response variable, which results in a single parameteric model being chosen
# for each response variable. Those choices are used in the ensuing script in
# the pipeline, "solvey_US_multivariate.R", which generates the best
# conditionally independent ('cindep') and conditionally dependent ('cdep') 
# multivariate models.
